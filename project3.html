        <h4> Aims</h4>

    <div class="containertext">
        <p> The developed world has grown astronomically since the 19th century. Much of this growth came 
            off the back of a coal-fuelled industrial revolution, which lifted millions from poverty and 
            has produced the comfortable lives many of us have today. However, for much of the world, 
            this standard of living is still a far-cry away. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most emphatic 
            case of this. My project aims to assess the extent to which the relationship between energy 
            usage and development still exists and how Sub-Saharan Africa can and should leverage this.              
        </p>
   </div>

    <div class="containertext">
        <h4> The strength of the relationship</h4>


         <p> The map below highlights how development varies so drastically around the world and how underdeveloped
             countries are often geographically group. The almost unanimously light green western Europe and North 
             American regions and the redness of Sub-Saharan Africa epitomise this. I obtained my GeoJson required for 
             the map from <a href="https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/"> this site </a> and downloaded the HDI data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index"> Our World in Data </a>, which was in long form and 
             did not require cleaning. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">      
        <div class="chart" id="chart1">
            <script>
                var myChart1 = "ProjectMap2.json";
                vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
            </script>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="containertext">
    <p>The line graphs build on this idea of geographically concentrated development further. 
        They show Sub-Saharan Africa consistently faces the worst outcomes across a variety 
        of metrics. I scraped the data for these graphs <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-cdML1KqeEpC3_r1XpZRLhTnV2MASoXt"> here </a> using the World Bank API, 
        specifying to extract only regional level data.  </p>

    <p>I then investigated whether similar patterns could be seen in energy access. The following map demonstrates
         how low access to electricity seems to be a problem faced almost uniquely by Sub-Saharan Africa and not 
         other developing regions. I used the same GeoJson and a CSV downloaded from the World Bank. An issue I 
         came across with both maps was that the country names in my CSV files did not match the country names 
         seen in my GeoJson. I used this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YHFpdyCGmD28Z5HTC2LkX_Ug6jPWLVC6#scrollTo=3rE-uDAz5oC7"> workbook </a> 
         to identify these countries before manually editing my 
         CSV file so the names matched, and the countries would appear on my maps.  </p>

        <p> To see whether decreasing carbon intensity has been associated with better air quality, I

    <p> The UK has enjoyed decreasing CO2 emissions since 1990 as shown by the green wedge; 
        this chart is my attempt to identify how much of this decrease can be explained by a 
        shift to more renewable electricity generation. To do this, I first performed a simple 
        projection of emissions in the UK, holding the electricity generation mix and CO2/capita 
        fixed at 1985 levels, and adjusting for population growth. This is the top line of the area 
        chart. The blue wedge shows the reduction in emission attributed to an increase in renewable 
        energy, and the purple section is all other factors. In 2018, roughly 31% of the reduction 
        in emissions could be attributed to greener electricity production. Data was cleaned and a 
        more thorough explanation behind my calculations is

    <div class="containertext">
        <p> This chart shows an API developed by <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/"> 
            carbonintensity.org. </a> predicting the carbon intensity of the national grid 
            48 hours in advance. Currently, renewable energy can only be used as it is being 
            generated. When demand for electricity outstrips the amount being produced renewably,
            the National Grid uses other storable energy sources (fossil fuels) to match this
            demand. By using electricity at times when demand is low, then we can reduce the 
            amount of fossil fuels needed to supplement electricity generation. That means try
            to only charge your phone at night! </p>
        
         <p> For this particular API, to chart data between certain dates in Vega, you had
             to manually input these dates, meaning the chart didn’t auto-update. To solve 
             this, I hacked the URL in JavaScript, changing the dates to ‘today’s date’ +/- 2 days.
             I then loaded in the Vega-Lite specification directly into my project.html file,
             changing the URL data to this new auto-updating URL. You can see this (+ a better explanation) 
             <a href="https://github.com/jamesjeffery77/jamesjeffery77.github.io/blob/main/project.html"> here </a>.

    <h4> Conclusions</h4>
    <p> Yes – we should care, and we should continue to adopt policies encouraging renewable
        electricity generation. Further work can be done to improve my projection of UK emissions 
        and to identify the reduction of CO2 emissions attributable to a greener electricity mix. 
        Further work could also use the carbon intensity API for specific companies / institutions
        to identify when might be a good time to run their electricity intensive processes. </p>
