            <p>The developed world has transformed since the 19th century. Much of this growth came off the back 
                of a coal-fuelled industrial revolution, which lifted many out of poverty and contributed
                 to the comfortable standard of living enjoyed by many today. However, much of the world, 
                 particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, has not yet reached this level of development. My project 
                 aims to explore the connection between energy usage and development and how Sub-Saharan Africa 
                 can leverage this relationship.</p>

                <h4> The strength of the relationship</h4>
        
        
                 <p>The map below highlights the significant variations in development around the world 
                    and how underdeveloped countries are often geographically group. The almost unanimously 
                    light green western Europe and North American regions and the redness of Sub-Saharan Africa 
                    epitomise this. The GeoJSON file for the map was obtained from <a href="https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/"> this site </a>. 
                    The HDI data was downloaded from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a> in long form, which made it useable in Vega-Lite.</p>

                using the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> API. Notably, some data points were missing over the specified 
                period for various regions. I removed these to avoid distorting the charts.</p>

        <div class="containertext">
            <p>To investigate whether similar patterns existed in energy access, I created a map using the same GeoJSON file and 
                 a CSV downloaded from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>. The map shows that low access to electricity is largely a problem faced 
                 by Sub-Saharan Africa, rather than other developing regions. For both maps, I encountered a problem with the 
                 country names in the CSV not matching those in the GeoJSON, so I used this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YHFpdyCGmD28Z5HTC2LkX_Ug6jPWLVC6#scrollTo=3rE-uDAz5oC7"> workbook </a> to identify some discrepancies 
                 and manually edited the CSV to ensure that the countries would appear correctly on both maps.</p>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        </div>
    
        <p>After establishing this trend in energy access, I then tested the relationship between development 
            and energy consumption with a regression. I merged CSV files from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>
             and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a>. 
            Notably, when merging, some countries that did not share a common name in both datasets were lost.
            I also dropped all rows with variables that showed “NaN” as this would discredit my results. 
            Given the sample left was still large, these lost variables did not significantly disrupt my analysis. I 
            then merged this dataframe with a region list so countries from different regions could be distinguished 
            in my visualisation. I removed high income countries and one clear anomaly, Turkmenistan, to increase 
            the relevance of the analysis to Sub-Saharan Africa. The relationship proved 
            very strong (R2=0.77). The workbook used is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15pGtC4vR-J8TY9mJUb1HLYErlWToG6SK">here</a>.

        <h4> How could Africa source the energy needed for growth? </h4>
    </div>
    <p>I then turned to address the question of how Africa could increase their energy consumption. The area 
        chart below demonstrates how Africa has and still does largely rely on non-renewables. However, by 
        adding a drop-down selector, this allowed me to highlight the increasing use of renewables such as solar and wind. 
        I obtained the data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a> via CSV download. The data 
        was in wide form so I converted it to long form in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18sZruXj_g-sxCyts8ely4sgIDJvJnl_K">workbook</a> so 
        it could be processed in Vega-Lite. I also renamed the variables with numbers in front to indicate 
        the order in which I wanted them to be stacked in my area chart. </p>

    <div class="containertext">    
        <p>I further investigated the relative growth of different energy sources with an index chart, using 
            the same dataset. This clearly showed how wind and solar have been by far the 
            fastest growing energy sources in Africa recently.  </p>

        <p>To explore the potential for renewable energy sources to contribute to Africa's development, I analysed trends 
            in their overall energy generation costs. The line chart shows how the costs have 
            consistently fallen, making them a more viable alternative to non-renewables. The data (<a href="https://www.irena.org/">IRENA</a>) 
            was in wide form, so I converted it to long form in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r99HFfhWRaxQbarPnxZ2_nbh9QSbikRD">workbook</a>.</p>

    <div class="containertext">    
        <p>My final chart raises the question of whether Sub-Saharan Africa is justified in increasing 
            energy consumption by any means necessary. It displays how Sub-Saharan Africa’s emissions 
            are dwarfed by North America. This suggests that the environmental impact of increasing 
            non-renewable energy consumption in Africa would be relatively small compared to the developed world. 
            The data was obtained from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> API and converted from XML to JSON format.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
</div>

    <p>My analysis shows a strong relationship between development and energy and suggests 
        that limited access to energy may have hindered development in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
        While a small portion of Africa's current energy comes from non-renewables, the use 
        of renewable energy sources has been growing rapidly in recent years. This offers a 
        potential path towards a more sustainable future. Moreover, increasing energy consumption 
        through non-renewables would only lead to a relatively small increase in CO2 emissions. 
        Therefore, it raises a further question: is it appropriate for the developed world to 
        intervene and prevent this when this is how they themselves developed?</p>
